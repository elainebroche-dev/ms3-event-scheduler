<h1 align="center">Event Scheduler</h1>

[View the live project here](https://ms3-event-scheduler.herokuapp.com/)

Event Scheduler is a command line application to manage data relating to events such as talks/lectures and bookings for those events.

The user can interact with the application to view upcoming events and bookings, review past events and see how popular they were (% seats booked), add new events, cancel upcoming events, create and delete bookings linked to upcoming events. 

The event and booking data is stored in an external Google Spreadsheet.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories - as a user I want to be able to :

  1. Easily navigate between the different functions availabe in the application.
  2. View information on upcoming scheduled events in the events spreadsheet - event ID code, title, scheduled date, host and number of seats available to book
  3. Use the application to book new events and have these stored in the events spreadsheet.  
  4. Cancel events and log a reason for cancellation in the events spreadsheet.
  5. Automatically remove all bookings linked to a cancelled event from the bookings spreadsheet and return a list on screen of those details so that attendees can be notified.
  6. View information on bookings for upcoming scheduled events - event ID code, scheduled date, attendee name, attendee email, number of seats booked
  7. Add a new booking for an upcoming event.
  8. Cancel a booking in the bookings spreadsheet.
  9. Review and analyse data for past events, this information should include :
      - details on cancelled events including the reason given for cancellation
      - details on events that went ahead including the number of seats that were available and % seats booked 
      - a total number of cancelled events
      - a total number of events that went ahead
  10. Clearly understand how to interact with the application and get feedback on updates to the underlying data.
  

## Features

### Existing Features

how do I want dates to work ? - this needs to go into the readme to clarify
upcoming should show today and the future for both bookings and events
Can cancel events or bookings for >= today
Can create events or bookings for >= today
review events should show data < todays date



- ###  __F01 Main Menu__
    - The main menu is displayed when the application starts.  To keep the interface simple to use and uncluttered the menu divides the functionality into three high level areas, 1) Event related actions, 2) Booking related actions, 3) Analysis/Review of data for events in the past.  

      ![Main Menu](documentation/images/f01-main-menu-1.png)

    - The user is prompted to choose one of the menu options by entering it's option number.  If the user enters an incorrect value an error message is displayed, then once the user presses Enter the screen is refreshed and the main menu is shown again.  

      ![Main Menu Message](documentation/images/f01-main-menu-2.png)

    - The main menu is repeatedly refreshed and re-displayed while inputs from the user are invalid and after each menu option 1 - 3 completes.  The application is terminated by selecting option 4 from the main menu.

- ###  __F02 Manage Events sub-menu__
    - From the main menu, when the user selects option 1 they are brought to the Manage Events sub-menu (see the below image).  Like the main menu, this menu is repeatedly refreshed and re-displayed while inputs from the user are invalid and after each menu option 1 - 3 completes.

      ![Events Menu](documentation/images/f02-manage-events-submenu.png)

    - The functions to view, add and cancel upcoming events are all accessible through this menu.  Selecting option 4 returns the user back up to the main menu (F01).

- ###  __F03 Show Active/Upcoming Events__
    - If the user selects option 1 from the Manage Events sub-menu they are shown a list of events from the events spreadsheet where the scheduled date for the event >= current date.  Cancelled events are not included in the displayed list.  
    
    - The SEATS OPEN column values are calculated by taking the Capacity value for the event from the events spreadsheet, and then deducting all seats currently booked for that event - so the SEATS OPEN value shows how many seats are still bookable for that event.  Bookings added or cancelled while using the application will be reflected in the SEAT OPEN value when the Show Active Events option is subsequently run.

      ![Active Events](documentation/images/f03-show-active-events.png)

- ###  __F04 Add Event__
    - To add a new event the user selects option 2 from the Manage Events sub-menu.  The application displays a message on screen listing the inputs it requires and displays an example input string of values (see image).

      ![Add Event](documentation/images/f04-add-event.png)

    - If the inputs entered by the user do not meet the validation requirements the user will be asked to re-enter them, or they can quit the operation and return to the Manage Events menu by entering 'x'.
    
    - The rules for the input values are as follows :
      - inputs are separated by commas, all inputs must have a length > 0
      - the combination of Event Code and Date must be unique within the events spreadsheet 
      - Date should have a format of DD-MM-YYY and must be >= current date
      - The Capacity value must be an integer > 0

    - When the user inputs valid data the application displays multiple messages to provide information on how the data is being processed and a new row is added to the events spreadsheet for the new event.  Once the operation is complete and the user presses Enter, they are returned to the Manage Events sub-menu.

      ![Add Event Success](documentation/images/f04-add-event-success.png)

    - The image below shows the new row added the end of the events spreadsheet :

      ![Add Event Row](documentation/images/f04-add-event-spreadsheet.png)

- ###  __F05 Cancel Event__
    - To cancel an event the user selects option 3 from the Manage Events sub-menu.  The application displays a message on screen listing the inputs it requires and displays an example input string of values (see image). 

      ![Cancel Event](documentation/images/f05-cancel-event.png)

    - If the inputs entered by the user do not meet the validation requirements the user will be asked to re-enter them, or they can quit the operation and return to the Manage Events menu by entering 'x'.
    
    - The rules for the input values are as follows :
      - inputs are separated by commas, all inputs must have a length > 0
      - Date should have a format of DD-MM-YYY and must be >= current date (events that have already happened cannot be cancelled)
      - The Event Code and Date combination must exist as an active (not already cancelled) event in the spreadsheet

    - When the user inputs valid data the application displays messages to provide information on how the data is being processed.  Cancelled events are not deleted from the events spreadsheet, instead they are updated to have a value of 'cancelled' in the Status column and the input Reason string provided by the user is stored in the Reason column of the spreadsheet.

    - Cancelling an event has the side-effect of deleting all associated bookings for the event from the bookings spreadsheet.   During the cancel event operation the bookings effected are listed on screen to let the user know what bookings have been removed and prompt them to contact attendees to inform them.
    
    - Once the operation is complete and the user presses Enter, they are returned to the Manage Events sub-menu.  

      ![Cancel Event Success](documentation/images/f05-cancel-event-success.png)

    - The image below shows a section of the events spreadsheet with the cancelled event :

      ![Cancel Event Row](documentation/images/f05-cancel-event-spreadsheet.png)

- ###  __F06 Manage Bookings sub-menu__
    - From the main menu, when the user selects option 2 they are brought to the Manage Bookings sub-menu (see the below image).  Like the main menu, this menu is repeatedly refreshed and re-displayed while inputs from the user are invalid and after each menu option 1 - 3 completes.  Selecting option 4 returns the user back up to the main menu (F01).

      ![Bookings Menu](documentation/images/f06-manage-bookings-submenu.png)

    - The functions to view, add and cancel bookings for upcoming events are all accessible through this menu.  

- ###  __F07 Show Active/Upcoming Bookings__
    - If the user selects option 1 from the Manage Bookings sub-menu they are shown a list of bookings from the bookings spreadsheet where the scheduled date for the event >= current date.   The data shows the Event Code, Date of the event, Name of person who booked, Email address and number of seats for this booking.  

      ![Active Bookings](documentation/images/f07-show-active-bookings.png)

- ###  __F08 Add Booking__
    - To add a new booking for an event the user selects option 2 from the Manage Bookings sub-menu.  The application displays a message on screen listing the inputs it requires and displays an example input string of values (see image).

      ![Add Booking](documentation/images/f08-add-booking.png)

    - If the inputs entered by the user do not meet the validation requirements the user will be asked to re-enter them, or they can quit the operation and return to the Manage Bookings menu by entering 'x'.
    
    - The rules for the input values are as follows :
      - inputs are separated by commas, all inputs must have a length > 0
      - the combination of Event Code and Date must exist in the events spreadsheet and must be active (not cancelled) 
      - Date should have a format of DD-MM-YYY and must be >= current date
      - Email address must have a valid format - e.g. contain @ with alphanumerics on either side
      - The Seats value must be an integer > 0 and must not exceed the number of seats available (calculated as the event Capacity from the events spreadsheet minus total seats reserved on all existing bookings for this event)

    - When the user inputs valid data the application displays multiple messages to provide information on how the data is being processed and a new row is added to the bookings spreadsheet for the new booking.  Once the operation is complete and the user presses Enter, they are returned to the Manage Bookings sub-menu.

    - Duplicate bookings are allowed - the same person can make multiple bookings for a single event. 

      ![Add Booking Success](documentation/images/f08-add-booking-success.png)

    - The image below shows a section of the bookings spreadsheet with the new row added :

      ![Add Booking Row](documentation/images/f08-add-booking-spreadsheet.png)

- ###  __F09 Cancel Booking__
    - To cancel a booking the user selects option 3 from the Manage Bookings sub-menu.  The application displays a message on screen listing the inputs it requires and displays an example input string of values (see image). 

      ![Cancel Booking](documentation/images/f09-cancel-booking.png)

    - If the inputs entered by the user do not meet the validation requirements the user will be asked to re-enter them, or they can quit the operation and return to the Manage Bookings menu by entering 'x'.
    
    - The rules for the input values are as follows :
      - inputs are separated by commas, all inputs must have a length > 0
      - Date should have a format of DD-MM-YYY and must be >= current date (bookings for past events cannot be cancelled)
      - The Event Code, Date and Email combination must exist in the bookings spreadsheet

    - When the user inputs valid data the application displays messages to provide information on how the data is being processed.  Cancelled bookings are deleted from the bookings spreadsheet.
    
    - Once the operation is complete and the user presses Enter, they are returned to the Manage Bookings sub-menu.  

      ![Cancel Booking Success](documentation/images/f09-cancel-booking-success.png)

- ###  __F10 Review Past Events__
    - From the main menu, when the user selects option 3 the Review Past Events functionality runs.  This feature examines all events with a Date < current date and also examines associated bookings.  On screen the following information is derived from the data and displayed to the user :

      - A table listing of all cancelled events which includes the Reason column 
      - A table listing of all events that went ahead which includes columns showing capacity of the event, the total seats booked and total seats booked as a percentage of capacity.
      - Numeric total of cancelled events
      - Numeric total of events that went ahead

      ![To be written](documentation/images/f10-review-past-events.png)

- ###  __F011 User prompts and messages__ 
    - The user is given feedback regularly to let them know the status of processing and what the application is attempting to do.  To keep the terminal as uncluttered as possible, the screen is cleared after each operation (e.g. add or cancel), on each transition to a new menu and each time the user needs to re-enter data.  Functionality to pause processing and allow the user time to review the feedback before clearing the screen has been added -  the user is asked to "Press Enter to continue"  before the clear screen happens and the application moves on.

    - Examples of the messages that are displayed on successful execution of actions such as Review Past Events or Add Booking etc. are shown in the screen shots detailing the features above.   In addition, the application displays a range of error messages specific to error type when attempting data validation.  Some examples are below :

    - Example of error message displayed if the user does not enter the correct number of inputs :

      ![User Messages 1](documentation/images/f11-user-messages-1.png)

    - Example of error message displayed if the user enters an invalid date value :

      ![User Messages 2](documentation/images/f11-user-messages-2.png)

    - Example of error message displayed if the user attempts to cancel an event in the past :

      ![User Messages 3](documentation/images/f11-user-messages-3.png)

- ### __How these features support the User Stories__

    - The User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) part of this document are numbered 1 to 10.  The existing features are listed above as F01 to F11.  Below is a traceability matrix cross-referencing the user stories with the features, illustrating which features support which stories :

        ![User Story Feature Matrix](documentation/images/us-feat-matrix.png)

### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __Appropriate UI__

  As this application uses the command line interface it is not very user friendly for a human end-user.  An obvious future feature of this application would be to build a better user-interace layer using HTML/CSS and possibly Javascript to make it much more intuititve to use.

- __Extended Data Model__

  The data model representing the Events and Bookings is very simplistic in what data elements it stores.  This could be extended to store additional data with more complex data relationship rules.  The data model and code could also be re-structured to use a better Object Oriented approach, where Events and Bookings could be handled as Object types with methods and attributes.

- __Extended Data Analysis__

  The Review Past Events feature of the application gives a breakdown of cancelled events vs events that weren't cancelled and shows % seats booked for those that went ahead.  Analysis of the data could be extended to find other information from the data, such as how frequently are certain events cancelled due to lack of bookings, which courses are most popular etc. and then this information could help the users plan ahead when trying to schedule events.  This type of information could also potentially be used to automate some tasks - e.g. automatically send an administrator an email highlighting a particular event has below a certain threshold of bookings coming up to it's scheduled date, so that the administrator has time to take action - e.g. send out a marketing email to draw attention to the event.

### Known bugs

- Problem with clear screen.

    Originally the clear function was implemented using the below code snippet :
        
          if name == 'nt':
            _ = system('cls')
          else:
            _ = system('clear')

    the reference for this code is: [Clear Screen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clear-screen-python/).  

    This worked fine when testing within the gitpod environment, but did not work when the application was deployed to Heroku.  No error messages or warnings were displayed when the application was run on the Heroku platform, the clear screen simply did not do anything.
    To solve this problem I replaced the above code with this code :

        print('\033c')

    the reference for this code is: [Clear Screen - ASCII sequence](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084508/clear-terminal-in-python/2084521).
    This appears to to work when tested in the gitpod environment and in the version deployed to Heroku.

  notes on deployment :
  usual git stuff needed

The Code Institute Python Essentials template was used to build the project Gitpod workspace.  This template
includes files and code to support deployment in a mock terminal on a web page.

A newline character was added to the end of each string used with the input function because due to how the
software to create the mock terminal works, the newline is needed so that the text for the input request shows
on screen.

The requirements.txt file in the project was updated to include details on the project dependencies.
Steps to do this are :

1. Enter the following command at the terminal prompt : 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt'
2. Commit resulting changes to requirements.txt and push to github

Login to your Heroku account.  If you don't have one, create one on www.heroku.com.  Enter your name, email and 'Student' can be selected for the Role value.  Choose a value for Country based on your location and select "Python" as the Primary development language.  

Once the Create button has been clicked, Heroku will send a confirmation email, to complete account creation click on
the link in this email.

Heroku will then bring you to a page to set up your password and log in.

Accept the Heroku terms of service and then you will be brought to the dashboard for your account.

If this is a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, alternatively you can find a link to this function under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.

From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.

On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select your region.  Then click Create app.

You will then be brought to the application configuration page for your new app.  The important tabs on this page are Deploy and Settings.

Click on the Settings tab and then scroll down to the Config Vars section to set up the private Environment Variables for the application - i.e. the credentials used by our application to access the spreadsheet data.

*** Be careful here !!! we need details on how exactly to create the creds.json file as this is not something that is available
to someone other than ourselves - so need to back up here on this *****
Click on Reveal Config Vars.  In the field for key enter 'CREDS' and paste the entire contents of the creds.json file into the VALUE field and click ADD

Next, scroll down the Settings page to Buildpacks.  Click Add buildpack, select Python from the pop up window and click on Save changes.  Click Add buildpack again, select Node.js from the pop up window and click on Save changes.  It is important that the buildpacks are listed on the page in the order shown in the diagram.

Now go to the Deploy tab for the application configuration.

Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub.  Enter the name of the github
repository (ms3-event-scheduler) and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.

Scroll down the page and decide if you want to Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project.
Manual Deploy was selected and then Deploy Branch clicked. Log messages displayed to show the build messages.

Click on View to launch the application.
Address for this deployed app is ()

redeploy from the deploy page after each push
