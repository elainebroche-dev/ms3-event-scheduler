<h1 align="center">Event Scheduler</h1>

[View the live project here - to be written]()

Event Scheduler is a command line application to manage data relating to events such as talks/lectures and bookings for those events.

The user can interact with the application to view upcoming events and bookings, review past events and see how popular they were (% seats booked), add new events, cancel upcoming events, create and delete bookings linked to upcoming events. 

The event and booking data is stored in an external Google Spreadsheet.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories - as a user I want to be able to :

  1. Easily navigate between the different functions availabe in the application.
  2. View information on upcoming scheduled events in the events spreadsheet - event ID code, title, scheduled date, host and number of seats available to book
  3. Use the application to book new events and have these stored in the events spreadsheet.  
  4. Cancel events and log a reason for cancellation in the events spreadsheet.
  5. Automatically remove all bookings linked to a cancelled event from the bookings spreadsheet and return a list on screen of those details so that attendees can be notified.
  6. View information on bookings for upcoming scheduled events - event ID code, scheduled date, attendee name, attendee email, number of seats booked
  7. Add a new booking for an upcoming event.
  8. Cancel a booking in the bookings spreadsheet.
  9. Review and analyse data for past events, this information should include :
      - details on cancelled events including the reason given for cancellation
      - details on events that went ahead including the number of seats that were available and % seats booked 
      - a total number of cancelled events
      - a total number of events that went ahead
  10. Clearly understand how to interact with the application and get feedback on updates to the underlying data.
  

## Features

### Existing Features

how do I want dates to work ? - this needs to go into the readme to clarify
upcoming should show today and the future for both bookings and events
Can cancel events or bookings for >= today
Can create events or bookings for >= today

### Known bugs

- Problem with clear screen.

    Originally the clear function was implemented using the below code snippet :
        
          if name == 'nt':
            _ = system('cls')
          else:
            _ = system('clear')

    the reference for this code is: [Clear Screen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clear-screen-python/).  

    This worked fine when testing within the gitpod environment, but did not work when the application was deployed to Heroku.  No error messages or warnings were displayed when the application was run on the Heroku platform, the clear screen simply did not do anything.
    To solve this problem I replaced the above code with this code :

        print('\033c')

    the reference for this code is: [Clear Screen - ASCII sequence](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084508/clear-terminal-in-python/2084521).
    This appears to to work when tested in the gitpod environment and in the version deployed to Heroku.


## Deployment

### How this site was deployed - to be written

- to be written

  The live link can be found here - [???????](to be written) 


  notes on deployment :
  usual git stuff needed

The Code Institute Python Essentials template was used to build the project Gitpod workspace.  This template
includes files and code to support deployment in a mock terminal on a web page.

A newline character was added to the end of each string used with the input function because due to how the
software to create the mock terminal works, the newline is needed so that the text for the input request shows
on screen.

The requirements.txt file in the project was updated to include details on the project dependencies.
Steps to do this are :

1. Enter the following command at the terminal prompt : 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt'
2. Commit resulting changes to requirements.txt and push to github

Login to your Heroku account.  If you don't have one, create one on www.heroku.com.  Enter your name, email and 'Student' can be selected for the Role value.  Choose a value for Country based on your location and select "Python" as the Primary development language.  

Once the Create button has been clicked, Heroku will send a confirmation email, to complete account creation click on
the link in this email.

Heroku will then bring you to a page to set up your password and log in.

Accept the Heroku terms of service and then you will be brought to the dashboard for your account.

If this is a new account an icon will be visible on screen to allow you to Create an app, alternatively you can find a link to this function under the New dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.

From the Heroku dashboard, click the Create new app button.

On the Create New App page, enter a unique name for the application and select your region.  Then click Create app.

You will then be brought to the application configuration page for your new app.  The important tabs on this page are Deploy and Settings.

Click on the Settings tab and then scroll down to the Config Vars section to set up the private Environment Variables for the application - i.e. the credentials used by our application to access the spreadsheet data.

*** Be careful here !!! we need details on how exactly to create the creds.json file as this is not something that is available
to someone other than ourselves - so need to back up here on this *****
Click on Reveal Config Vars.  In the field for key enter 'CREDS' and paste the entire contents of the creds.json file into the VALUE field and click ADD

Next, scroll down the Settings page to Buildpacks.  Click Add buildpack, select Python from the pop up window and click on Save changes.  Click Add buildpack again, select Node.js from the pop up window and click on Save changes.  It is important that the buildpacks are listed on the page in the order shown in the diagram.

Now go to the Deploy tab for the application configuration.

Select GitHub as the Deployment Method and if prompted, confirm that you want to connect to GitHub.  Enter the name of the github
repository (ms3-event-scheduler) and click on Connect to link up the Heroku app to the GitHub repository code.

Scroll down the page and decide if you want to Automatically Deploy each time changes are pushed to GitHub, or Manually deploy - for this project.
Manual Deploy was selected and then Deploy Branch clicked. Log messages displayed to show the build messages.

Click on View to launch the application.
Address for this deployed app is ()

redeploy from the deploy page after each push









### How to clone the repository - to be written

- Go to the https://github.com/elainebroche-dev/ms2-anagram repository on GitHub 
- Click the "Code" button to the right of the screen, click HTTPs and copy the link there
- Open a GitBash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to locate the clone
- On the command line, type "git clone" then paste in the copied url and press the Enter key to begin the clone process
- Changes made to the local clone can be pushed back to the repository using the following commands :

  - git add *filenames*  (or "." to add all changed files)
  - git commit -m *"text message describing changes"*
  - git push

- N.B. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project
